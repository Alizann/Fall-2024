# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("dplyr")
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_data <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.


```{r}
cocktail_data_clean <- cocktail_data %>%
  # separate ingredients into separate rows
  separate_longer_delim(ingredients, delim = regex("<.*?>")) %>%
  # clean the ingredients of all quantities by removing all digits and
  # non-word characters followed by a space, one or more word characters, and
  # a space
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "[\\d\\W]+\\s\\w+\\s")) %>%
  # remove the indicator of alcohol content by removing everything between
  # parentheses
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\([^)]*\\)")) %>%
  # trim whitespace and convert all ingredients to title case
  mutate(ingredients = str_to_title(str_trim(ingredients))) %>%
  # tidy up some spelling mistakes
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "Marschino", "Maraschino")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "Cr\u008fMe", "Creme")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "Sugard", "Sugared")) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = ifelse(ingredients == "Saline", "Saline Solution",
                              ifelse(ingredients == "Simple", "Simple Syrup",
                                     ingredients))) %>%
  # replace "Clarified Lime Juice Or Champagne Acid" with more common
  # ingredient "Clarified Lime Juice"
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove(ingredients, " Or Champagne Acid")) %>%
  # remove rows where both name and ingredient are dplicated
  distinct(name, ingredients, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
cocktail_data_clean %>%
  # select the ingredients column
  select(ingredients) %>%
  # sort in alphabetical order
  arrange(ingredients) %>%
  # remove duplicates
  unique() %>%
  # print as data frame
  as.data.frame()
```


## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
cocktail_data_clean %>%
  distinct(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(`Number of different ingredients` = n())
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
cocktail_data_clean %>%
  group_by(ingredients)

cocktail_data_clean %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(Frequency = n())

cocktail_data_clean %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(Frequency = n()) %>%
  slice_max(n = 10, order_by = Frequency)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktail_data_clean %>%
  # for each cocktail
  group_by(name) %>%
  # count the number of ingredients
  summarise(n_ingredients = n()) %>%
  # extract cocktails with the most ingredients
  slice_max(n = 1, order_by = n_ingredients)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  # for each ingredient
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  # calculate the number of times it appears in the data set
  summarise(Frequency = n()) %>%
  # extract ingredients that appear once
  filter(Frequency == 1) %>%
  select(ingredients) %>%
  unlist(use.names = FALSE)

# number of ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
length(rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
cocktails_with_rare_ing <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  # filter for rare ingredients
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients) %>%
  # select distinct cocktails
  distinct(name) %>%
  unlist(use.names = FALSE)

cocktails_with_rare_ing
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktail_data_clean %>%
  # filter for cocktails without rare ingredients
  filter(!(name %in% cocktails_with_rare_ing)) %>%
  # select distinct cocktails
  distinct(name) %>%
  unlist(use.names = FALSE)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
cheat_sheet <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  # add a column with "X"
  mutate(X = "X") %>%
  # convert the data to wide format where each ingredient is a column
  pivot_wider(names_from = ingredients, values_from = X, id_cols = name,
              values_fill = "") %>%
  # convert to matrix
  as.matrix()

# set matrix rownames to cocktail names
rownames(cheat_sheet) <- cheat_sheet[, 1]
# remove the first column
cheat_sheet <- cheat_sheet[, -1]

# print the matrix
cheat_sheet
```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
